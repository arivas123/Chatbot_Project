Here is a project I did that was inspired from a natural language processing class that I took. 
The project was to create a crude chatbot that was similar to ELIZA, with features. 
The code was originally done in Python, but since I wanted to get more practice with C++, 
I figured out how to change it to C++ and also added more features. 
The chatbot is still not fully complete, as there are still problems with it, but it is something I am actively working on. 

Here is how to run: 
Run this command firs: g++ -std=c++11 -arch arm64 -o chatbot chatbot.cpp
Then: ./chatbot
